## Project Description

The project involves the following key components:

1. **Data Loading and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We load data from an Excel file containing information about building characteristics and heating/cooling loads. EDA helps us understand the dataset's structure.

2. **Data Cleaning and Outlier Detection**: We perform data cleaning and use Z-scores to identify and manage outliers effectively.

3. **Data Summary and Correlation Analysis**: Statistics for each column are generated, and correlations between selected features and heating/cooling loads are explored.

4. **Data Visualization**: Scatter plots and heatmaps are used to visually represent relationships between features and loads.

5. **Feature Importance Analysis**: We utilize a Random Forest model to identify which features have the most significant impact on heating and cooling loads.

6. **Linear Regression Models**: Basic linear regression models are implemented for load prediction, and their performance is rigorously evaluated.

7. **Feature Scaling and Normalization**: The importance of data standardization is demonstrated through feature scaling and normalization.

8. **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: This technique is employed to evaluate the model's performance under various data splits, providing a comprehensive view of its reliability.

9. **Comparison of Models**: The project concludes with a comparison of different models, highlighting the Decision Tree Model as the top performer.

10. **Actionable Insights**: The findings offer valuable insights and recommendations for optimizing heating and cooling loads in building design.
